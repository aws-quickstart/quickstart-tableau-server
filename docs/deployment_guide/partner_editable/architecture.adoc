image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets, managed network address translation (NAT) gateways for outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
* In a private subnet, an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance that contains Tableau Server.
* An Application Load Balancer to route traffic to Tableau Server over HTTPS.
* Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) to store Tableau Server files.
* Amazon Route 53 to map the fully qualified domain name to the load balancer Domain Name System (DNS).
* A Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate managed by AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) on the load balancer to encrypt all traffic between the internet and the load balancer.
