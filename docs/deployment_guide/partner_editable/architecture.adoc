image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
* In the private subnets:
** Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance that contains Tableau Server.
* An Application Load Balancer to route traffic to Tableau Server over HTTPS.
* A Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate managed by AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) on the load balancer to encrypt all traffic between the internet and the load balancer.
* An Amazon Route 53 record set that maps the fully qualified domain name to the load balancer DNS.
* An Amazon S3 bucket to store Tableau Server files.

[.small]#* The template that deploys this Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
